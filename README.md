# FastPlannerOctomap

## Obstacle avoidance for drones using FastPlanner (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner), PX4 and Octomap.


## Modules

*********

### Mapping
* Mapping has been done using Octomap  
* Fixed size euclidean distance map is computed using EDT3D Library (https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap/tree/devel/dynamicEDT3D) for collision check.
* Fixed Size EDT map gets updated around the drone after it travels a threshold distance from the previous location at which map was updated (here threshold is 1 metres).
* Point cloud from the RGBD sensor (RealSense D415 and D455 were tested) is downsampled using pcl_ros

> Installing mapping dependencies
>> sudo apt-get install ros-$DISTRO-octomap-*  
>> sudo apt-get install ros-$DISTRO-pcl-ros

>> git clone https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap
>>> Octomap source code is needed to generate EDT map (DynamicEDT3D class)

>> cd octomap

>> mkdir build

>> cd build

>> cmake .. && make

>> sudo make install

#

### Planning
* Path planning is done using Fast-Planner (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Fast-Planner) developed by HKUST Aerial Robotics Group.
* Currently only the kino-dynamic A* star algorithm has been implemented (implementation of the Bspline optimization with octomap is going on currently)
* Changes have been made in the source code in order to use it with Octomap.
* Goal location is currently given in cartesian coordinates (using RViZ 2D Nav Goal and height of the goal is taken from the user)

#

### Control
* PX4-Autopilot firmware has been used to control the drone (https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot).
* Trajectory generated by the planner is traversed using offboard position control.
* Position messages (with and without yaw) is published on the topic /mavros/setpoint_local/position.
* Mavros has been used to pass the waypoints to the Pixhawk flight controller.

> Installing PX4-Autopilot
>> Refer to https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot for setting up PX4 for simulation

> Installing Mavros
>> sudo apt-get install ros-$DISTRO-mavros ros-$DISTRO-mavros-extras

>> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh

>> sudo bash ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh   

#

### Localization
* GPS is used for localizing the drone 
* Poses given by the EKF in PX4 is used (/mavros/local_position/pose)
